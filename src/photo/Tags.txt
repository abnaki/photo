SRGBRenderingIntent
How the image should be displayed as defined by the International Color Consortium (ICC).

Perceptual intent, which is suitable for photographs, gives good adaptation to the display device gamut at the expense of colorimetric accuracy. Relative colorimetric intent is suitable for images (for example, logos) that require color appearance matching that is relative to the display device white point. Saturation intent, which is suitable for charts and graphs, preserves saturation at the expense of hue and lightness. Absolute colorimetric intent is suitable for proofs (previews of images destined for a different display device) that require preservation of absolute colorimetry.
